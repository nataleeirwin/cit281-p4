# Project 4

This project was designed to gain experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment, breaking a project into manageable components, and using modern JavaScript syntax. 

We also practiced writing and executing Node.js REST API server using VSCode, using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and route parameters, using Postman to test web server routes, and working with JSON.


### Elements

- Create project files, initialize Node project file, and add fastify
- Create data file
- Import data into code module
- Create and test code module functions
- Export code module functions
- Create and test REST API server
- Extra Credit: Add support for POST
